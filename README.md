This mod adds a `/cape` command to Minecraft, which allows you to use any cape you want.

All the capes listed [here](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Cape) are available, with custom capes being
a planned feature.

Feel free to report any bugs, or suggest new features, at the issue tracker.

## License

## Usage

Mod builds can be found [here](https://github.com/eclipseisoffline/capecommand/packages/2064482) and on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/cape-command).

This mod requires the Fabric API, and is currently available for Minecraft 1.21 and 1.20.5+6/1.20.4 (no longer updated),
though version port requests are welcome, just open an issue at the issue tracker.

When installed on the client, you'll be able to use the `/cape` command in single-player worlds,
and on servers that also have the Cape Command mod installed.

When installed on the server, only clients with the Cape Command mod installed will be able to see
other people's capes. Clients that do not have the Cape Command mod installed will only be able to
see their own cape, with a few exceptions.
