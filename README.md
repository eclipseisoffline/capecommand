This mod adds a `/cape` command to Minecraft, which allows you to use any cape you want.

All the capes listed [here](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Cape) are available, with custom capes being
a planned feature.

Feel free to report any bugs, or suggest new features, at the issue tracker.

## Version support

| Minecraft Version | Status       |
|-------------------|--------------|
| 1.21.4            | ✅ Current    |
| 1.21.2+3          | ✔️ Available |
| 1.21+1            | ✅ Current    |
| 1.20.5+6          | ✔️ Available |
| 1.20.4            | ✔️ Available |

I try to keep support up for the latest major and latest minor release of Minecraft. Updates to newer Minecraft
versions may be delayed from time to time, as I do not always have the time to immediately update my mods.

Unsupported versions are still available to download, but they won't receive new features or bugfixes.

## Usage

Mod builds can be found [here](https://github.com/eclipseisoffline/capecommand/packages/2064482) and on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/cape-command).

This mod requires the Fabric API.

When installed on the client, you'll be able to use the `/cape` command in single-player worlds,
and on servers that also have the Cape Command mod installed.

When installed on the server, only clients with the Cape Command mod installed will be able to see
other people's capes. Clients that do not have the Cape Command mod installed will only be able to
see their own cape.

Note: if your server has Geyser installed, then Bedrock players will also be able to see everyone's capes, as well as use all the capes the mod provides.
