# Cape Command

This mod adds a `/cape` command to Minecraft, which allows you to use any cape you want.

All the capes listed [here](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Cape) are available, with custom capes being
a planned feature.

Feel free to report any bugs, or suggest new features, at the issue tracker.

## License

This mod is licensed under GNU GPLv3.

The textures of all capes included are copyright Mojang Studios. All rights to them
are owned by Mojang and Microsoft.

This mod is not an official Minecraft product and is not approved by or associated with Mojang or Microsoft.

## Usage

When installed on the client, you'll be able to use the `/cape` command in single-player worlds,
and on servers that also have the Cape Command mod installed.

When installed on the server, only clients with the Cape Command mod installed will be able to see
other people's capes. Clients that do not have the Cape Command mod installed will only be able to
see their own cape, with a few exceptions.
